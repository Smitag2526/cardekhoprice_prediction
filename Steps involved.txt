Steps to start with the new project in python

1. Create a new enviornment (carprediction) -python 3.7

conda create -n carprediction python=3.7

2. Activate carprediction by typing - activate carprediction

3. Copy the path where you have kept the data file or location where you want and launch the jupyter notebook from there 

for example : cd C:\Users\Smita Gavandi\Documents\python_excelR\LENOVO\R Excel Sessions\Assignments\endtoend_projects\cardekho_price



###How to make requirement.txt

1.goto anaconda prompt
2.Type activate carpredicition
3.Goto path in which you have all folder files like cd C:\Users\Smita Gavandi\Documents\python_excelR\LENOVO\R Excel Sessions\Assignments\endtoend_projects\cardekho_price
4.Search how to create requirement.txt in python in Google. 
5.Type pip freeze > requirements.txt in the prompt
6. you will get the requirement.txt with all the libraries

Once it is done next step is work on app.py

for that first install flask in the carprediction environment
Then pip install jsonify
pip install requests

Then type python app.py

You might get some errors regarding module not found like for example no module named 'sklearn' , so in this case we will need to pip install all these libraries
